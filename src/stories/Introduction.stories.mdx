## storybook

This web-view is a tool to use both for consumers of the component to see it in action in isolation, and for
contributors to have a responsive view as they make changes. This should go hand-in-hand with testing
using `jest --watchAll`.

To get started, select the component in the menu on the left and either click through some pre-defined configurations
or play with the controls in the page to get a feel for it.

## API

RunningCostGraph takes in series to plot. 

Each series has:

 - A start time 
 - A number-of-steps to take through time
 - A time-delta which determines how long each step is (all the steps are uniform)
 - A formula, which will be evaluated at every time step. The formula is given the following *immutable* arguments:
  - the last value
  - the index of the current step
  - the result of all steps so far
 - A starting value for the series.
